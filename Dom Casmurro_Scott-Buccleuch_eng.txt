THE TITLE


One evening on my way home to Engenho Novo from town I met a young fellow on the Central Line train. He lived in the neighbourhood, and I knew him vaguely by sight. He greeted me, sat down beside me, talked about one thing and another and ended up reciting poetry. The journey was short, and his verses may not have been altogether bad. But it happened that I was tired, and I dozed off once or twice, causing him to break off his reading and put his verses back in his pocket.

‘Don’t stop,’ I said, waking up.

‘I’ve finished,’ he muttered.

‘They’re very good.’

"I saw him make as if to take them from his pocket again, but it was only a gesture; he was offended. Next day he began calling me names and finished up nicknaming me ‘Lord Taciturn’. The neighbours, who don’t like my quiet retiring habits, seized upon the nickname, which finally stuck. Not that this worried me. I told the story to some friends in town, and for fun they began calling me that, too, some even in letters: ‘Lord Taciturn, I’m coming to dine with you on Sunday.’ ‘I’m going to Petropolis, Lord Taciturn; that same house in Renânia. Drag yourself from that den of yours in Engenho Novo and come and spend a fortnight with me.’ ‘My dear Lord Taciturn, don’t think I’m letting you off the theatre tomorrow. Come and spend the night in town. I’ll provide the box, tea and a bed; the only thing I can’t provide is feminine company.’"

"Don’t bother to look it up in the dictionary. ‘Taciturn’ is used in the most usual sense of a man who says little and keeps to himself. ‘Lord’ is ironic, to endow me with aristocratic airs. All because I happened to doze off! Anyway I couldn’t find a better title for my story, and if I can’t think of one before the end of the book I’ll keep to this. My poet on the train will know that I bear him no ill will. And with a little imagination, since the title is his, he may come to think the book is his, too. There are books that owe no more to their authors; others even less."

THE BOOK


Now that I have explained the title I will pass on to writing the book. First, however, let me outline the motives that led me to take up my pen.

I live on my own, with one servant. The house where I live is my own property, and I had it built for a very special reason, which I hesitate to admit, but no matter. One day, many years ago, I had the idea of building in Engenho Novo an exact replica of the house where I was brought up in the old Rua de Matacavalos, having the same design and appearance as the first one, which has now been demolished. The builder and decorator fully understood my instructions, so it is virtually the same two-storeyed house, with three front windows, a veranda at the back and identical bedrooms and other rooms. In the main room the decoration on the ceiling and walls is more or less the same, with here and there huge birds carrying wreaths of small flowers in their beaks. In the four corners of the ceiling are the figures of the seasons, while in the middle of the walls are painted busts of Caesar, Augustus, Nero and Masinissa, with their names written underneath. Why these four personages I do not know. When we moved to the house in Matacavalos that was how it was decorated, a left-over from the previous decade. It was of course fashionable then to add a classical touch and figures of antiquity to American paintings. All the rest is in the same vein. I have a garden with flowers, vegetables, a forest oak, a well and a wash-house. I use old china and old furniture. Now, as then, there is the same contrast between the calm of my interior life and the bustle of life in general.

"It is clear that my purpose was to link together the two ends of my life, to re-create my adolescence in my old age. But it proved impossible to reconstruct what then was or what I was myself. In everything, if the face is the same the appearance is different. If it were just that the others had gone, all well and good; a man soon recovers more or less from their loss. But it is I myself who am lacking, and that loss is fatal. It is a poor comparison, but what remains is like the dye you put on your beard and hair, which merely preserves the outward appearance, as they say at autopsies. The internal parts cannot be dyed. A certificate to say I was twenty years old might, like all false documents, fool a stranger but not me. The few friends I have are of recent date; all the others have departed to study geology in heavenly fields. As for women friends, some are of fifteen years’ standing, others of less, and almost all assert their youth, two or three even convincingly. But the language they speak obliges me to consult the dictionary so frequently as to become tiresome."

However, if life has changed, that is not to say it is worse. It is different. In certain aspects my former life appears bare of many charms I thought it had, while it is also true that it has lost many of those thorns that made it irksome. Yet I am not without tender, beguiling memories. To be honest I don’t go out much, and I converse even less. I have few pastimes. Most of my time I spend in my orchard, gardening and reading. I eat well and don’t sleep badly.

But everything palls after a while, and this monotony ended up by wearying me. I needed variety and thought of writing a book. Jurisprudence, philosophy and politics came to mind but were not sufficiently appealing. Then I thought of writing History of the Suburbs, less dull than Father Luis Gonçalves dos Santos’s memoirs of the city. But, though an unassuming work, it would require research into documents and dates, a lengthy and boring process. At that point the busts on the walls spoke up saying that if they hadn’t been able to re-create times past for me I should take up my pen and do so in writing. Perhaps the narration would evoke the illusion, summoning forth those shades, as once happened to the poet, not him of the train, but of Faust: ‘Come ye again, restless shades?’

I was so delighted with this idea that even now my pen trembles in my hand. Yes, Nero, Augustus, Masinissa and you great Caesar, who urge me to write these memoirs, I am grateful for your advice and shall put on paper all my recollections as they come flooding back. In this manner I shall live again what I lived then and turn my hand to a work of greater import. So, then, let us begin with a celebrated November afternoon that I have never forgotten. I have had many others, both better and worse, but that one has never been erased from my memory. Read on, and you will understand what I mean.

THE ACCUSATION


"I was about to enter the living-room when I heard my name mentioned and hid behind the door. The house was the one in Matacavalos, the month was November and the year somewhat remote, but I don’t intend to change the dates of my life just to please those who don’t like old stories; the year was 1857."

‘Dona Glória, are you still intending to send our Bentinho to the seminary? It’s high time he went, and now there may be a problem.’

‘Problem? What problem?’

‘A difficult problem.’

My mother wanted to know what it was. José Dias, after a few moments’ consideration, came to see if there was anyone in the corridor. Not noticing me, he returned and, lowering his voice, said that the problem was in the house next door: the Páduas.

‘The Páduas?’

‘I’ve been meaning to tell you this for some time, but hardly dared. It doesn’t seem right to me that our Bentinho should be hiding away in corners with the Tortoise’s daughter. That’s the problem, because if they start flirting seriously you’ll have a difficult job separating them.’

‘I don’t believe it. Hiding away in corners?’

‘In a manner of speaking. Secretly. Always together. Bentinho is never out of their house. The girl is a scatterbrain. The father pretends not to notice, probably hoping things will turn out so that … I understand your reaction. You don’t believe people can be so calculating, thinking that everyone is as well-meaning and honest …’

‘But, Senhor José Dias, I’ve seen the two playing together and noticed nothing whatever suspicious. Think of their age: Bentinho is barely fifteen, and Capitu was fourteen only last week. They are only children. Don’t forget they have been brought up together ever since that great flood in which the Pádua family lost so much. That was when we got to know each other. And now you expect me to believe … What do you think, Brother Cosme?’

Uncle Cosme replied with a ‘Hum’, which translated into ordinary language might mean ‘José Dias is imagining things. The kids enjoy themselves. I enjoy myself. Where’s the backgammon?’

‘Yes, I think you must be mistaken.’

‘It’s possible. I hope you are right. Believe me, I would not have spoken without giving the matter the most careful thought …’

‘In any case, it’s time he went,’ interrupted my mother. ‘I’ll see about sending him to the seminary right away.’

‘Well, as long as you haven’t given up the idea of making a priest of him, that’s the main thing. Bentinho must do as his mother wishes. And then the Brazilian Church has a great destiny. We must not forget that a bishop presided over the Constituent Assembly and that Father Feijó governed the empire …’

‘Governed my foot!’ put in Uncle Cosme, giving way to old political rancour.

‘Pardon me, doctor. I’m not defending anyone, merely stating facts. What I want to say is that the clergy still has an important role to play in Brazil.’

‘What you want is a good drubbing. Come on, go and fetch the backgammon. As for the boy, it would be better if he didn’t start saying mass behind doors. But look here, Sister Glória, does he really have to be a priest?’

‘It’s a promise and has to be kept.’

‘I know you made a promise. But a promise like that … I don’t know … I think if we considered it carefully … What do you think, Cousin Justina?’

‘Me?’

‘The truth is that each one knows what is best for himself,’ went on Uncle Cosme. ‘Only God knows what is best for everyone. But a promise made so many years ago …What’s this, Sister Glória? Are you crying? Come now. Is this a matter for tears?’

My mother blew her nose without answering. I think Cousin Justina got up and went to her. There was a long silence, and I was just about to enter the room, but something held me back, a stronger feeling … I couldn’t catch the words that Uncle Cosme suddenly spoke. Cousin Justina was pleading, ‘Cousin Glória! Cousin Glória!’ José Dias was apologizing. ‘If I had known I wouldn’t have spoken – but I did so out of respect, out of esteem, out of affection, to fulfil a duty, the bitterest of duties.’
